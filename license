Quick summary:

1. Private distributinog and modification is fine
2. Publicly distributing a non-modified, or little-modified is not fine
3. Using small snippets of the code for your own project is fine
4. ColDog Studios is not liable for anything, no warranties are attached either
5. Don't copy someone else's exact code and call it your own. Not cool.
